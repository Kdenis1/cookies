A peanut butter cookie is a type of cookie that is distinguished for having peanut butter as a principal ingredient. The cookie originated in the United States, its development dating back to the 1910s.[1] If crunchy peanut butter is used, the resulting cookie may contain peanut fragments.
These treats became popular during the 1900s. In 1913, the wife of former US President Woodrow Wilson published her list of cookie recipes which included that for creating peanut butter cookies.
